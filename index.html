								My greatest time in college was spent with these beautiful people. Granted this is just the few of them I worked on a monstorous project with back in 2010. I met and worked with many more. We were a part of an student club to bring environmental awareness to the University and Bangladesh.That being said, this short description doesn't do justice to my three years with them.
